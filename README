"unjumble" is a
uh

example:

    % sh -c 'echo this & echo is & echo a & echo test &' >$(unjumble 0>output)
    % cat output
    [2021-01-27 06:33:41] dash[68896]: this
    [2021-01-27 06:33:41] dash[68899]: test
    [2021-01-27 06:33:41] dash[68898]: a
    [2021-01-27 06:33:41] dash[68897]: is

it's for redirecting the output of multiple programs into a file **but with
timestamps and process names included**

unjumble works by secretly creating a FUSE filesystem and returning a path to a
file inside it, so that it can receive `write()` calls to it directly and find
out the process responsible for each one

it then writes the line with added details to file descriptor 0 (the `0>output`
redirection in the example is specifying the output file)

the filesystem is automatically unmounted when the virtual file is no longer
open in any process (in the example, when all the shell processes have exited)
